## Yes, quiet is better

The bulk of my work experience was in various electrical power generation plants. Hot, loud, dangerous are apt adjetives. 

Last week I observed my eighteeth year. I got a very nice 35mm f2.8 macro to mark the day.

I'm here to learn about git and git hub. Both items will serve admirably in my main mission - C. I know I know, what about (fill in your fave). I'm looking at a foundation. Also, if one can do well in C, other diciplins come easily, at least, in this neophyte's view. And, jeeze,is it fast! In school some work was done in Pascal and Basic - it is only a slight exaggeration to say that one could node off waiting for results.
